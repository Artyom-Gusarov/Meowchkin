# Game rules
Each player starts with 1 level and 4 cards. The goal of the game is to reach 10 levels. The last level can only be achieved by killing a monster.

## Cards

### Spells
Cards that have an effect on a monster or player and have a limited duration. Spells can be played in any phase of the game.

### Equipment
Equipment gives bonuses to the player's attack and defense, as well as other bonuses. Each piece of equipment has a cost. Each player can wear only one helmet, one armor, one pair of shoes, and take two hand items (or one two-handed item).
You can remove equipment at any time, but you can only put it on at the beginning or end of your turn.

### Monsters
Monsters have strength and nastiness. If a manchkin loses a battle to a monster and fails to escape, they must perform the nastiness.

## Phases of the Game
### Preparation
You prepare for your journey, thinking about your strategy. You play cards from your hand that you think are necessary.
### Opening the Door
Draw one card from the dungeon deck. If it's a monster, go to the battle phase. If it's a spell, apply it to the player. Otherwise, add it to your hand.
### Battle
By default, a manchkin must have more strength than the combined strength of the monsters to win. If you win, you gain 1 level (2 if indicated on the card) and the treasure indicated on the card.
### Escape
If you lose, you can try to avoid the nastiness by rolling a 5 or higher on a dice. If you fail to escape and the monster is still pursuing you, you must perform the nastiness.
Searching for Trouble:
If you haven't encountered monsters when opening the door, you can play a monster card if you have one and fight it. If you don't like fighting monsters, you can simply take two cards from the dungeon deck.
### End of Turn
All goes back to normal. You can do the same things you did during preparation, and when you get bored, you can end your turn.
